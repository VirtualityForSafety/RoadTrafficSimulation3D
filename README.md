# RoadTrafficSimulation3D
A 3D road traffic simulation that contains a intersection-wise automatic city generator, vehicles and their routes generation, and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) based on the Volkhin's code https://github.com/volkhin/RoadTrafficSimulator

## Motivation
This project was motivated by SCPAR(Safety-Critical Peripheral Augmented Reality) project that results the papers below:
* Ensuring Safety in Augmented Reality from Trade-off Between Immersion and Situation Awareness, Jinki Jung, Hyeopwoo Lee, Jeehye Choi, Abhilasha Nanda, Uwe Grünefeld, Tim Claudius Stratmann, Wilko Heuten, 17th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)
* Guiding Smombies: Augmenting Peripheral Vision with Low-Cost Glasses to Shift the Attention of Smartphone Users, Uwe Grünefeld, Tim Claudius Stratmann, Jinki Jung, Hyeopwoo Lee, Jeehye Choi, Abhilasha Nanda, Wilko Heuten, 17th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)

## Functionality
1. Intersection-wise city generation
2. Intelligent Driver Model-based vehicle agent
3. Capture scene from a pedestrian’s point of view (backside)
4. Save / load of specific scenario (reproducibility)
5. Automatic training/testing dataset generation for ground-truth data

## Tested environment
* Windows 10
* Unity3D 5.6.3p1

## Configuration
* -TBD

## Tutorial
* -TBD
