    //so it's huge buckets of sweat to reproduce the scene tools unity already has.

    //which are more like compounds of assets, rather than raw assets.

    //This function collates all the the behaviours you want in the directory you point it at. The path is relative to your Assets.
    //i.e. "Assets/MyDirectory/"
    //It returns the Prefab References, remember! Not instantiated scene objects! 
    //So it's only used for *editor-side* tools. Not run time.
    //Quite useful in conjunction with "PrefabUtility".
